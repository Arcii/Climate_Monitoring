/**
 * Provides the views classes and IntelliJ Swing UI Designer forms for the graphical user interface of the Climate Monitoring client application.
 *
 * <p>
 * The package includes nine classes each class is a view (Window of the application) and has a corresponding controller in the {@link com.climatemonitoring.clientCM.gui.controllers}
 * package.
 * These views classes are only used to define the design of the GUI and providing getters and setters to the components inside them.
 * All the logic of a view class is inside the corresponding controller.
